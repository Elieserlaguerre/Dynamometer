The productivity management protocol will be the first interface that I create after the
registration page! it's purpose is to monitor my performance on a personal level, financial level,
as well as professional/business level.
this interface will not only provide proactive consistent reliable surveillance of my performance
from these 3 vital angles but it will also assist me in the management process of these angles
by enabling me to automate the flow of value between these various facets of my life!
this interface corresponds with the first of the 5 pillars of productivity management:
1) monitor the nature of every exchange
2) promote the positive
3) eliminate the negative
4) moderate the neutrals
5) work within your budget while gradually cultivating it.

soon this software will be up and running and I intend to use it to track my progress
in everything!
I'm going to use my knowledge and newly developed skills to transform my life first, then the
rest of the world one system at a time!
